# Cifar10_dataset

The Cifar10 dataset is a collection of images that are commonly used to train computer vision algorithm. This dataset contains total 60000 images and having 10 different class.

Here, I have used convolution neural network for training the algorithm and I have got more than 80% accuracy with this model
